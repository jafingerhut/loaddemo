# loaddemo

A tiny demo project showing that one can create a Clojure namespace
whose contents are spread across multiple files, with the 'main' one
using clojure.core/load to load the other files.

There is no requirement to ever use this capability of Clojure, and
many applications and libraries do not do this, instead choosing to
put all of the code that is in the same namespace into a single file.


## Usage
